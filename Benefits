- allows dynamic change of parameters (doesn't SimpleBlobDetector::Params do this too?)
- features ultiple threshold algorithms, including Otsu's
- user defined filter classes
- findContours uses CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE (as opposed to SimpleBlobDetector, which uses CHAIN_APPROX_NONE)
- filtering by color actually uses a range of colors
